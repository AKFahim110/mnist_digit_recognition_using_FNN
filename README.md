# mnist_digit_recognition_using_FNN
This project implements a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model for classifying MNIST handwritten digits. The FNN has 3 hidden layers with ReLU activation, followed by an output layer. Key features include configurable model architecture, training/validation, accuracy evaluation, and utility functions.
